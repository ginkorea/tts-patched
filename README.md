# TTS-PATCHED

This is a patched version of [Mozilla's TTS](https://github.com/mozilla/TTS), modified to:

- Remove all `trainer` dependencies
- Enable compatibility with Python 3.11 and Python 3.13
- Allow inference-only mode (no training support)
- Simplify for offline/local usage, especially for projects like Lobi
